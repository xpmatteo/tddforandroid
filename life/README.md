This is an Android port of Ilias Bartolini's Game of Life.  Ilias' version has
a Swing UI.  This is a simple Android spike for me (Matteo); not a polished thing at all.  Since it's just a spike, there are no tests.

See https://github.com/iliasbartolini/design_principles_dojo for the original code.

Search for "xpmatteo" on Google Play if you want to install a binary.
