## What will we learn?

 - Driving development from acceptance tests
 - Writing end-to-end tests
 - Driving development from true unit tests
 - How to keep the pure logic of the application separate from Android APIs (aka the ports-and-adapters architecture aka hexagonal architecture)
 - How to use mocks properly (aka the London Style)
 - Presenter-first development
 - What is the "main partition" and why it's useful
 - A bit of object-oriented design
